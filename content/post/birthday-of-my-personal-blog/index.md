# Welcome

Building this blog is just a test of my technical ability. But I will add more content in the future.

The world is in turmoil in 2020.
Time is continuous, 'a year' is actually just a number but does not necessarily mean everything will change totally after 31st December.
But I merely wish after 365 day's blood circulation,
Flaming heart beats again with a short rest.

Let me conclude with the poem [**Snowdrops** by *Louise GlÃ¼ck*](https://readalittlepoetry.wordpress.com/2012/12/28/snowdrops-by-louise-gluck/)

> afraid, yes, but among you again
> crying yes risk joy
> in the raw wind of the new world.

Hope you find your own new world.
